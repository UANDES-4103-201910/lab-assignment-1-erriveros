At first glance you are able to see 2 separation in the structure of the code structure of the website:
    1) Head: Wich we can identify by <head> (tag to open the header) and </head> (tag to close it), anythinig between those two tags is what makes up the head. In this particular head, their apears to be no code wich makes a direct impact on the visual apect of the site. We are abel to see 3 diferent types of tags:
        a) <meta>: The meta stands for metadata, this  <meta> tag provides data about the data on your page.
        b) <link>: The <link> tag defines a link between a document and an external resource.
        c) <title>: The <title> tag defines the title of the page and can be seen on the top of the web browser next to the page icon.
    2) Body: Wich is identified by the <body> tag. In here we are able to see the code wich builds the visual aspect of the page. In this case the content inside the body is separated by rows in a table. We are able to see various tags:
        a)<center>: This tag is to center-align the content inside the tag.
        b)<table>: This tag is to create the table
        c)<tbody>: Short for table body, defines where the table body goes
        d)<tr>: Short for tabel row, defines a row of the table
        e)<td>: Defines a cell in the the table row
        f)<a>: Defines a hyperlink
        g)<span>: Used to group elements
        h)<script>: Defines the client-side script, in this case pointing to where the code lies.
